## Workflow
### 1. Functional connectome gradient analysis
Functional connectome gradients were identified using the BrainSpace toolbox.
   
## 2. Characterizing the growth pattern of the sensorimotor-association gradient
   
## 3. Lifespan association between the S-A gradient and functional segregation-integration dynamics
   
## 4. Lifespan association between the S-A gradient and structural hierarchies

## 5. Lifespan association between the S-A gradient and cognitive spectrum

## 6. Sensitivity analysis
